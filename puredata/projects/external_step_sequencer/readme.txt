HOW TO

GUI
top radio bar controls the length of the sequence

Sliders control pitch (corresponds to the degree in the scale, value goes up to 16)

3 radio boxes control octave (bottom == lower, top ==higher)

Length goes from 1/16 - 3/16 length notes

velocity self explanatory

Toggles at bottom trigger the note

17th channel sets all parameters

BOTTOM
pick scale using radio button (just above transport)

Number box is for the root of the scale to be used

Swing adds a bit of swing to sequence by delaying every other 8th note slightly (max is 1/16)

Channel number to send the midi message out

Test toggle prints data to consolse (for debugging)

Transport for bpm and to run.
