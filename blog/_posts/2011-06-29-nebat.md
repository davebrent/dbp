Nebat is an interactive composition patch created in Pure Data. It aims to explore computer improvisation and algorithmic composition. The idea was to create a composition system that would allow the user to record a basic idea into the system and have that idea expanded upon by the computer in a style that would make sense to what was recorded into it.

You will need to download pd-extended 0.41.4, PDJ (java external for pure data) and to bear in mind I have only tested this on a mac. Somethings may not work on other computers.
