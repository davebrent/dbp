Over the past few months Ive begun to try and consolidate all my old [Pure data](http://puredata.info/), [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/) patches and bits of code that I wrote related to making noises.

Ive decided to start this blog (and copy over a couple of posts from my old one) to document some of these patches and scripts as I begin to move them into a git repository, partly for myself but also for anyone who may be interested in using or adapting them.

The main themes that I think will come up will be, granular synthesis, concatenative synthesis, audio analysis, audio visualisation and various generative algorithms.

The goals for most of these experiments was simply curiosity, wanting to create weird noises and rhythms that I could then sample to create a piece of electronic music. Other bits were attempts to try and reverse engineer things I thought were interesting.

All the code and patches will be hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/davebrent/dbp) on github.
