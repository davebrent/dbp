title: Automated sonification of non audio files
---

The sonification of non-audio files is a well known [data bending] [1]
technique that can generate interesting and abrasive noises. Often its
done in programs such as [Audacity] [2] that can open raw files and interpret
them as audio.

I wanted to find a way to automate this process as I was getting bored of
clicking around Audacity when trying out a handful of files.

After looking at the code in Audacity that is responsible for importing raw
files it was nice to see [nothing magic was happening] [3]: most of the code
is setting up a dialog and guessing default values for it. The main part
simply opens the file with [libsndfile] [4] with a major format of
``SF_FORMAT_RAW`` and sets [sub formats] [5] based on the result of the dialog.

  [5]: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/api.html#open

So I wrote a small command line [program] [6] that does the same thing: it takes
an input file, opens it with [libsndfile] [4] (providing options for available
formats) and writes the result out to a seperate file.

Here is a couple of example outputs from the program, the first is a small
selection from a 2gb virtual box file and the second is the ``.Framework``
file from [node-webkit] [7].
