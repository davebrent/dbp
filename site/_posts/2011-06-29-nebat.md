Nebat is an interactive composition patch created in Pure Data. It aims to
explore computer improvisation and algorithmic composition. The idea was to
create a composition system that would allow the user to record a basic idea
into the system and have that idea expanded upon by the computer in a style
that would make sense to what was recorded into it.

You will need to download pd-extended 0.41.4, PDJ (java external for pure data)
and to bear in mind I have only tested this on a mac. Somethings may not work
on other computers.
